We are a research group in the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology  
at the University of South Alabama.

Our lab is focused on understanding the structural biology of DNA repair proteins,  
with a particular interest in the base excision repair (BER) and mismatch repair (MMR) pathways.

We study how repair enzymes such as NEIL glycosylases help maintain genome stability  
and how they are involved in **cancer**, **aging**, and **neurodegeneration**. We also study how MMR proteins function in the context of a hereditary cancer syndrome called Lynch Syndrome. 

Our approaches include:

- **Cryo-Electron Microscopy (Cryo-EM)**

- **X-ray Crystallography**

- **Biochemical and Biophysical tools**

- **Nanobody development**

- **Mitochondrial biology**

We are passionate about advancing knowledge of DNA repair and its impact on human disease.
